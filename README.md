# üéì EduForge - Lecturer Management API

EduForge is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API to manage lecturers in an educational platform. It includes CRUD operations, supports multipart file uploads, and allows querying based on lecturer types.

---

## üõ† Project Evolution

This project was initially developed using **Spring Framework (without Spring Boot)** to manually configure key aspects like:
- Bean creation
- Dependency injection
- Transaction management
- Data source configuration
- Dispatcher servlet and context setup

This manual setup phase provided deep experience and understanding of Spring's core mechanisms.

Gradually, the project evolved:
1. Introduced **Spring AOP** for modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging and exception handling.
2. Transitioned to **Spring Boot**, leveraging auto-configuration, embedded server, and improved developer productivity.

## üß© Project Structure

- `controller/` ‚Äì REST controllers (e.g., `LecturerHttpController`)
- `advice/` - Global Exception handler
- `converter/` - Custom converter for LecturerType
- `exception/` - App Wide Exception for business logic and API
- `service/` ‚Äì Business logic interface and implementation
- `dto/` ‚Äì Data Transfer Objects (request/response)
- `util/` ‚Äì Utility classes and enums (e.g., `LecturerType`)
- `repository/` ‚Äì Spring Data JPA repositories
- `entity/` ‚Äì JPA entity classes
- `validation/` - Custom validation annotation for Profile Picture

---

## üöÄ Features

- Add new lecturers with file upload
- **Connects with Firebase Storage to save profile pictures**
- Retrieve, update, and delete lecturer records
- Filter lecturers by type (`full-time` / `visiting`)
- Form and JSON-based data input support
- Bean validation and custom validations
- Centralized exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice`
- Enum converters for request parameter binding

## üõ† How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vimukthijayasanka/eduforge-backend
   cd eduforge-backend
   ```

2. **Configure `application.properties`:**

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name
    spring.datasource.username=username
    spring.datasource.password=password
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    spring.datasource.hikaricp.maximum-pool-size=10
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=5MB
    
    application.firebase.storage.bucket=firebase-storage-bucket-name
    application.name=EduForge
    application.version=v1.0.0
    
    #logging.level.root=warn // logging level control
    logging.file.name=logs/app.log
    logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-history=30
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the API:**

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api/v1/lecturers
   ```

## üìé Notes

* Multipart endpoints use `@ModelAttribute` for binding.
* Validations and error responses are handled via standard Spring mechanisms.
* The project can be extended with features like pagination, search, and role-based access control.
